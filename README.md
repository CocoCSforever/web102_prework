## Notes
1. Challenge # 1 - Step 3 Learn about Git
“Take about 8 minutes to read through "An Easy Beginner's Guide to Git"” This resource is a member-only story on Medium which needs subscription.

2. Challenge # 1 - Step 4: Git Quiz!
What happens when executing the command git add index.js?
- A copy of the file index.js is created in the working directory (keyword: crib)
- A copy of the file index.js is added to the remote repo (keyword: harp)
- The file index.js is moved from the local repo to the staging area (keyword: best)
- The file index.js is moved from the working directory to the staging area (keyword: dive)

I don't think the last choice(keyword: dive) is accurate since the file is not "moved" from working directory to staging area,
The command stages the file index.js by taking a snapshot of its current state and placing it in the staging area(Adds a snapshot to staging area instead of moveing files from working directory to staging area).

3. Challenge # 2 - Step 3: Check out style.css
"Examine index.css" typo: should be "style.css"

4. Challenge # 7 - Destructuring
let a, b = [10, 20]
let func1, func2 = [(arg)=>arg*2, (arg)=>arg*3]
These two got me confused. I thought it should be let [a, b] = [10, 20] in js.
